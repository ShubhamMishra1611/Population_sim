This is a fun project that help us to understand how a population work.

There will be a population of creatures with some food , predators,some abilities like fast run,food recognizer,fighting,helping
we may implement bussiness and many more.

I am dividing this proj in some level(I don't know how many but atleast initial stage should be clear).

LEVEL1:
    1.It will be make classes of creatures with diffrent attributes and methods.
    2.Graphic visualisation using pygame.
    3.Implementing code like eating food,coliision with creature,food randomization.
LEVEL2:
    1.Implementing some abstract things like anger,kindness,hate,love,friendship,strategy,family,solitary,discrimination,etc. in the code.
    2.Plotting graphs of diffrent attributes
    3.Think about what to add as LEVEL3.
LEVEL3:
    1.Need to think


Attributes and method:
    creature
        Attributes       
            1."Life" for measuring how many days does the creature has lived
            2."Energy" for measuring how much energy a creature is having at any instant of time
            3."hungry" is a boolean parameter to tell if the creature is hungry or not.
        methods
            1.Move : To move the creature may be in any direction
            2.eat : to eat the food
    food
        Attributes
            1.life : to know how much life does a food have , its eneergy decreases with life increases
            2.energy : amount of energy it will tranfer to the creature who eats it
    nature
        contains all rule of the nature ...life ...dead ...reproduction...energy balance,etc.
